# Tuples are often used for fixed collections of data, and their immutability makes them useful for ensuring that data remains unchanged.
my_tuple = (1,2,3)

# Tuple Operations

# Tuples are Immutable

# Lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items in Python, but they have significant differences. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:

# Aspect	                            List	                                    Tuple
# Syntax	                            Defined using square brackets [].	        Defined using parentheses ().
# Mutability	                        Mutable (can be modified).	                Immutable (cannot be modified).
# Performance	                        Slower, due to mutability.	                Faster, due to immutability.
# Usage	Used for dynamic collections.	Used for fixed or constant data.
# Methods	                            Has more methods like append, remove, etc.	Fewer methods (e.g., count, index).
# Iteration Speed	                    Slower compared to tuples.	                Faster compared to lists.
# Memory Usage	                        Consumes more memory.	                    Consumes less memory.
# Example	                            my_list = [1, 2, 3]	                        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
